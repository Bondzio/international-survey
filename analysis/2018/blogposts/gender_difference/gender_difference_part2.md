## Difference in type of role.

To filter the participants and knowing which can be considered as Research Software Engineers and which is not, they were asked two questions with Yes-No answers.
* `Does the majority of your role comprise leading a group of software developers or RSEs?`
* `Do you write software for academic research as part of your job'`

These questions identify people that writing code, and/or lead a group of Research Software Engineers. It is possible to use the first question to see if there is a difference in access to leading role between gender. A chi-square test of independence was performed and no relation was found,  X2(1, N=789) = 0.343 p=0.559. It appears that the gender does not have an impact on the access to a leading position. Of course, there is more men than women in that position but it is does not seems that women will have more difficulties to access a leading role in RSE. The contingency table is shown in #tbl3.

| Leader of RSE group | No  | Yes |
|---------------------|-----|-----|
| Women               | 89  | 16  |
| Men                 | 560 | 124 |

However, as will see it is not necessarily the case. We asked people several questions about their job satisfactions.

## Difference in job satisfaction

* Presentation questions about job satisfaction
    * literature review
    * Reason of removing some questions (survey too long)
    * Presentation of each items and associated Likert scale
* Explanation of aggregating the measures
* Presentation of the radar plots
* (if time) doing a statistical analysis on the difference of mean between the two groups


### Transforming items into aggregated measure

It is possible to aggregate the items of a Likert scale to an aggregate score and use it to compare different groups. There is a debate on that question but here we decided that it could be informative to do nevertheless.

However, the following transformation need to be taken with caution.
